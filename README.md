# phpass 0.3


### What is this?
This is a simple mirror of [Openwall's](http://www.openwall.com/) "Portable PHP password hashing framework" called ["phpass"](http://www.openwall.com/phpass/).

### Why is this here?
I wanted a simple mirror of the framework that **I** could trust and use in my own projects as a submodule. I would have used one of the many other mirrors of this framework, but I really didn't want to give all of my trust to someone else. ;)

### Should I trust you?
I'd like to believe that you *can* trust me, but seeing as this is a framework that could decide the entire security of your app/service/system... I wouldn't. Just do what I did and create your own mirror. ;)

### Where can I get the *original* source?
That's easy, its available from Openwall's website as a [download](http://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/phpass/).


##### Have a nice day
